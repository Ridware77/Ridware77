Hi, I'm Ridware 77.
Iâ€™m interested in creating an SLI file to enable 3D printing of hemispherical gears.
My current interest is in proving that attempts to achieve translational propulsion by harnessing the angular momentum of spinning flywheels will not work due to the fact that the denials of conventional wisdom are not strong enough and rely too much on the conservation of energy/momentum argument.
